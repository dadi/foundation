    <h2 class="sub">How we started</h2>

    <p><strong><a href="https://dadi.cloud" target="_blank">DADI</a> established the Foundation as a natural extension of its work to democratise the Internet.</strong></p>

    <p>DADI is as a decentralised cloud services platform - a network collectively owned by the people rather than individual autonomous organisations. Taking this a step further, the Foundation enables technology to directly further the cause of democracy.</p>

    <p>DADI provided an initial donation of £200,000, and will continue to support the work of the Foundation contributing a percentage of all transactions in the network.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="cnt"><a name="approach" id="approach"></a>
    <h2 class="sub">Our approach</h2>

    <p>Technology poses a huge threat to basic rights: it has eviscerated privacy, amplified prejudice and undermined democracy. There is growing evidence of the need to reframe technology’s role in a world with an increasingly unequal distribution of wealth and power.</p>

    <p>The Founders believe that technology can and should act as a catalyst for greater equality, helping to address the root causes of injustice.</p>

    <p>We aim to ensure that technology is:</p>

    <div class="grid mt points">
      <div class="col w-1-3">
        <p><strong>Embedded</strong> as a key tool for advancing human rights across the globe</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col w-1-3">
        <p><strong>Accessible</strong> wherever it is needed to promote people’s basic rights</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col w-1-3">
        <p><strong>Developed</strong> with the protection of human rights as a core principle</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="cnt"><a name="plan" id="plan"></a>
    <h2 class="sub">Our plan</h2>

    <p>We will work with the tech industry and human rights sector to tackle the root causes of injustice, equipping future technologists and activists with the skills to build and participate in robust and inclusive democracies.</p>

    <p>We will find opportunities to prioritise capacity building, as well as facilitating the exchange of knowledge and skills between the Global South and North.</p>

            <p>We will support the next generation of coders to develop the skills and experience to fight inequality in their own communities and around the world. Following the lead of the Nominet Trust, we will bake social needs into the development of technology and the development of technologists.  We will also train human rights organisations in the language and skills needed to make the most of technological developments.</p>

    <h2 class="sub">Our principles </h2>

    <div class="principles">
      <h3>Partnership &amp; collaboration</h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.techforgood.global/" target="_blank">Tech for Good</a> community is young but growing incredibly quickly with a two-fold increase in the past two years. We will capitalise on this by working in partnership and continuing to deepen connections between human rights organisations and the tech world. </p>

      <h3>Equality &amp; Diversity</h3>
      <p>People’s understanding of our world is shaped by the technological environment in which they exist. The platform and algorithm are not neutral: they are created by humans and therefore created with prejudice. The architects of our digital lives are predominately young, white men. Diversifying the industry will help address this bias.</p>

      <h3>Independence</h3>
      <p>Our activities will always be consistent with achieving the Foundation mission and cannot promote the commercial interests of our founder, DADI. Any benefit that may accrue to the DADI group from our activities will be incidental and outweighed by the contribution to our charitable objectives. We operate an assurance system to identify, measure and validate this, which means we – not DADI – decide what we want to do, where we operate and who our partners will be.</p>

    <p>We are incredibly excited to announce our first CHALLENGE AWARD.</p>

    <p>Less than 50% of  people live in fully functioning democracies. Following more than a decade of declining global freedom, the rights of minorities, the rule of law, freedom of the press and free and fair elections are all under threat.</p>

    <p>We would love to hear from charities/not for profits who want to harness technology to support democracy. The successful applicant will receive £10,000 and expert support/mentorship. Get in touch to find out more.</p>
